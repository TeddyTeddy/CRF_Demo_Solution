CRF Demo App Improvement Ideas:
  - Register page
	- missing indicators for mandatory fields
	- missing checks for password field for the password strength
  - Login Page -> User Information Page -> Demo App -> Index Page
    but username is not clickable and it should take to main page

Register Form Has 5 Fields (attached the picture for the form):
 - Username
 - Password
 - First name
 - Family Name
 - Phone Number

When I check register() function in demo_app/auth.py (line 40), I see the following:
a) If username is missing, return an error. Otherwise continue with (b)
b) If password is missing, return an error. Otherwise continue with (c)
c) if user already exists with the given Username, then return an error, otherwise continue in (d)
d) Insert a new user entry with the given fields
e) redirect to Login page

Note that, in register() function, there is no validity checking for any of the 5 fields.
I assume that register() function is Work In Progress (WIP). It does not reflect the requirements fully yet.

So, me as a tester, I recommend the following requirements for the Register Form functionality:

1) All 5 fields are mandatory.
2) If any of the fields are missing, then "Field X is mandatory" error message is shown
3) All 5 fields are verified against their respective rules:
   a) Username:
	- Minimum 8 characters
        - Alpha numeric characters and non-alpha numeric characters are allowed
	- Space character is not allowed
   b) Password
	- Minumum 8 characters
        - Must include at least one character from the set [a-z]
	- Must include at least one character from the set [A-Z]
	- Must include at least one character from the set [0-9]
	- Must include at least one character from the set [!?.]

Imagine there is a person with full name: Helena Margaretha Holm Cuzdan.
Note that Margaretha is the 2.nd first name and Cuzdan is the 2.nd last name.

Imagine there is a person with full name: Ha Xi  (a valid Vietnamiese full name)

   c) First Name
	- Must take into account 2.nd first name if exists
	- Must contain letters from the set [a-zA-Z] for each word
	- Each word must be at least 2 letters (e.g. Ha)
        - Cannot contain numbers
	- Cannot contain non-alphanumeric characters
	- A single space must seperate the first names, if there are 2 first names (e.g. 'Helena Margaretha'
	  but not 'Helena     Margaretha')
   d) Last Name
	- Must take into account 2.nd last name if exists
	- Must contain letters from the set [a-zA-Z] for each word
	- Each word must be at least 2 letters (e.g. Xi)
        - Cannot contain numbers
	- Cannot contain non-alphanumeric characters
	- A single space must seperate the last names, if there are 2 first names (e.g. 'Holm Cuzdan' 
          but not 'Holm      Cuzdan')

   e) Phone number
	- I assume this is a mobile phone number from any country, not a fixed line.
	- Referring to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mobile_telephone_prefixes_by_country
	- May contain a single '+' character as the first character
	- May only contain numbers but not alphabetic characters [a-zA-Z] nor non-alphanumeric characters
	- cannot contain spaces
4) If any of the fields does fail against its respective verification, an error message is shown

Note that I will create test data based on the Register Form functional requirements (1)-(4).
Can I proceed with the requirements (1)-(4) I outlined?
